# SAS Optimization Challenge 2023: Final Exam Creation 📚✨

## Introduction 🌟
In this project, our team tackles the challenge of creating a rigorous final exam for a course in Operations Research. Using SAS optimization techniques, we aim to develop an exam that not only tests students comprehensively but also prepares them for success as future data scientists.

## Scope 🎯
The project involves selecting 50 questions from a bank of 154 to construct a challenging exam. Constraints include covering specific topic objectives and incorporating predefined questions, with the goal of maximizing the overall difficulty of the exam.

## Analysis 📊
**Tiered Approach to Exam Creation** 🔑
- **Tier 1 Objective:** Select the most difficult 50 questions while meeting topic coverage requirements.
- **Tier 2 Objective:** Further refine the selection by ensuring no overlap in "frenemy" groups.
- **Tier 3 Objective:** Include eight mandatory questions while maintaining the difficulty level.
- **Tier 4 & 5 Objectives:** Create two balanced, yet challenging exams, ensuring that specific questions appear in both, and a certain percentage of questions are common between them.

## Results 📝
- **Tier 1 Output:** Achieved an exam with an average correctness rate, suggesting high difficulty.
- **Subsequent Tiers:** Successfully integrated additional constraints while slightly adjusting the difficulty, illustrating the versatility and robustness of our optimization model.

## Conclusion & Future Learning Opportunities 🌍
This exercise not only provided us with a hands-on experience in optimization but also showcased the potential of SAS techniques in real-world applications like inventory management, production scheduling, and resource allocation.

## Recommendations 📌
- Future projects can explore more complex optimization scenarios, potentially integrating machine learning for predictive analytics in test creation.
- Continue refining the balance between difficulty and educational value in academic assessments.

## Deliverables 📦
- A set of two optimized exams, each fulfilling different sets of constraints.
- Detailed documentation on the optimization process and the rationale behind each decision.
- Insights into the potential application of these techniques in various business and academic contexts.
